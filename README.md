# Agent Observability
The repo is to demo a few concepts when it comes to agent observability for Semantic Kernel and Langgraph.

## Semantic Kernel
Semantic kernel demos how it is logging to the console, app insights, or an Aspire dashboard.

## Console.Python
It has a few notebooks to demo how to add observability to Langfuse and Arize with Langgraph.

## Sample Env Files
You will need to rename `sample.env.json` to `env.local.json` and fill in the values that are relevant to your environment.
